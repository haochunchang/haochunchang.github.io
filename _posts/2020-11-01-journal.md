## Today

* I was reading "Specification By Example". It is about how to deliver right software.
    * The main essence is to construct "Living Documentation System" that updates along with production code.
    * Other than functional unit tests, there are spec. tests that needs collaboration among Business, testers, analysts and developers.
    * From User stories, extract spec. scope, refine the spec. to write tests that can also be documentation and acceptance tests.
    * With spec. with example, everyone in the team can know the target of the software.
