## This is a note of CNN model architectures.
* For what is Convolution Neural Network (CNN), I recommend you to first read [this](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/).


---
## Image Classification
* There are pre-trained models trained on ImageNet in [keras.applications](https://keras.io/applications/).
* Pre-trained models are useful for transfer learning.

### [Inception (GoogLeNet)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842.pdf)
![Inception](/assets/images/cnn/Inception.png)

* Inception module: Various sizes of feature maps in parallel.
    * Useful in localization
    * Main Idea: 
> _Finding out how an optimal local sparse structure in a convolutional vision network can be approximated and covered by readily available dense components._

* Use 1x1 convolution to reduce dimension.

##### [InceptionV2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00567v3.pdf)

Factorized Convolution     |  Assymetric Convolution
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![inceptionV2_block](/assets/images/cnn/InceptionV2_block.png)  |  ![inceptionV2_block2](/assets/images/cnn/InceptionV2_block2.png)


* General Design Principles:
    1. Avoid representational bottlenecks: avoid extreme compression to info. loss
    2. Increase the activation per tile in CNN: train faster
    3. Spatial aggregation on lower dim embed: Maybe adjacent units have strong correlation.
    4. Balance the width and the depth of the network.
* Factorization of convolutions: 
    * Replace 5x5 conv by two 3x3 convs. (Exploit translation invariance again)
    * Replace 3x3 conv by 3x1 and 1x3 convs. (nxn $$\rightarrow$$ nx1 and 1xn)
    * Works well on m x m feature maps ($$m = 12\sim 20$$)
* Efficiently reduce grid size:
    * Convolution and Pooling done seperately and concat back.
    ![reduce_grid](/assets/images/cnn/InceptionV2_reduce.png)
* Label-smoothing regularization (LSR): Avoid model to assign labels too confidently
    * x / y = training example / label
    * k = labels, u(k) = a fixed distribution (e.g. u(k) = 1/K) 
    * Original label distribution: $$q(k\|x) = \delta_{k,y}$$
    * Smoothed label distribution: $$ q'(k) = (1 - \epsilon)\delta_{k,y} + \epsilon u(k) $$
        * Cross-entropy loss = $$H(q', p) = (1 - \epsilon)H(q, p) + \epsilon H(u, p)$$
        * $$H(u, p)$$ can be captured by [KL divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence).


### [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385v1.pdf)
![Residual Network](/assets/images/cnn/ResNet.png)

* Residual operation for reusing feature maps.
* Motivation: Deeper network produces **higher** training error $$\rightarrow$$ Degradation.
* Core building block: ($$W_s$$ is a linear projection to match dimensions)
$$
y = F(x, {W_i}) + W_sx
$$


### [DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06993v5.pdf)
![img](/assets/images/cnn/DenseNet.png)

* [Github](https://github.com/liuzhuang13/DenseNet)
* Densely-connected convolutional layers: 
    * Receive concatenation of feature maps from all preceding layers.
    * For $$l^{th}$$ layer, the output $$x_l=H_l([x_0, x_1,..., x_{l-1}])$$
    * Cannot perform pooling in Dense-connected blocks.
* Advantages:
    * Universal access of feature maps within Dense blocks.
    * Can reduce number of feature maps by 1x1 conv between Dense blocks.
    * Deep supervision, Feature reusage, Network compression.


### [MobileNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861.pdf)
![img](/assets/images/cnn/MobileNet.png)

* Essence:
> _The MobileNet model is based on depthwise separable convolutions which is a form of factorized convolutions which factorize a standard convolution into a **depthwise convolution** and a 1×1 convolution called a **pointwise convolution**._


* Seprate standard convolutional layer into 2 layers (With BatchNormalization and ReLU for layer outputs)

* Let:
    * $$D_{F/G}$$ = spatial dimention of feature map $$F/G$$
    * $$D_K$$ = spatial dimention of kernel $$K$$
    * $$M$$ = number of input channel, $$N$$ = number of output channel
    
* Standard Convolution
    * Assuming stride=1 and padding
$$
G_{k,l,n} = \sum_{i,j,m}{K_{i,j,m,n}F_{ {k+i-1},{l+j-1},m} }
$$
$$
i=row, j=col, m=input\space channel, n=output\space channel
$$

    * Parameter size of $$K = D_K\times D_K\times M\times N$$
    * Computation cost = $$D_K\cdot D_K\cdot M\cdot N\cdot D_F\cdot D_F$$


* Depthwise separable Convolution = Depthwise & Pointwise convolution
    * Depthwise convolutions: 1 filter per input channel
$$
\hat{G}_{k,l,m} = \sum_{i,j}{\hat{K}_{i,j,m}F_{ {k+i-1},{l+j-1},m} }
$$
        * Parameter size of $$\hat{K} = D_K\times D_K\times M$$
        * Computation cost = $$D_K\cdot D_K\cdot M\cdot D_F\cdot D_F$$
        
    * Pointwise convolutions = 1x1 convolution
        * Computation const = $$M\cdot N\cdot D_F\cdot D_F$$

    * Further reduction of cost: 
        * Width parameter: $$0 < \alpha <= 1$$
        * Resolution parameter: $$0 < \rho < =1$$
        * Computation const = 
$$
D_K\cdot D_K\cdot \alpha M\cdot \rho D_F\cdot \rho D_F + \alpha M\cdot \alpha N\cdot \rho D_F\cdot \rho D_F
$$

Overall Architecture     |  Inverted Residual
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![MobileNetV2](/assets/images/cnn/MobileNetV2.png) | ![invertedResidual](/assets/images/cnn/InvertedResidual.png)


* Main contribution: inverted residual with linear bottleneck
* Linear bottleneck:
    * Assume the "manifold of interest" lies in a low-dimensional subspace of the input space.
* Bottleneck Residual Block ($$F(x) = [A\circ N\circ B]x$$): Composition of 3 operators
    * Linear transformation: $$A: R^{s\times s\times k} \rightarrow R^{s\times s\times n}$$
    * Non-linear **per channel**: $$N: R^{s\times s\times n} \rightarrow R^{ {s}'\times {s}'\times n}$$
        * In this paper: $$N = ReLU6\circ dwise\circ ReLU6$$
    * Linear transformation: $$B: R^{ {s}'\times {s}'\times n} \rightarrow R^{ {s}'\times {s}'\times {k}'}$$
    * Represent inner tensor $$I$$ as concatenation of $$t$$ tensors of size $$n/t$$
$$
F(x) = \sum^t_{i=1}(A_i\circ N\circ B_i)(x)
$$
    * Get improvement because of
        1. Inner transformation is per-channel.
        2. Consecutive non-per-channel operators have significanct $$\frac{input\space size}{output\space size}$$.
        3. Recommended $$t = 2\sim 5$$ for avoiding cache miss in matrix multiplication.


### [Neural Arichitecture Search (NASNet)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07012v4.pdf)
![NASNet](/assets/images/cnn/NASNet.png)

* Search architecture for building blocks on smaller dataset and transfer to larger dataset.
* Use Reinforcement Learning to search building blocks.

* Two main blocks (Cells):
    1. Normal Cell: convolutional cell that return the same dimension.
    2. Reduction Cell: Heigh and width is reduced by factor of 2.
    
* Operations: Use common operation like conv, max-pooling, depthwise-seperable conv.
* Combination of 2 hidden states: 
    1. Element-wise addition
    2. Concatenation
    
* Controller RNN: one-layer LSTM with softmax predictions for each decision.

## Object Detection & Segmentation Using CNN

* For object detection & segmentation tasks, models need to output more fine-grained details.
* Thus, many other architectures and training schema for more efficiency were proposed.

### What is mAP?


### [Region-based CNN (R-CNN)](http://islab.ulsan.ac.kr/files/announcement/513/rcnn_pami.pdf)
![img](/assets/images/cnn/R-CNN.png)

* Flow: region proposals $$\rightarrow$$ CNN feature extraction $$\rightarrow$$ Image classification $$\rightarrow$$ BBOX regression
* Region proposals: category-independent methods
    * Examples: objectness, **selective search**, ...etc.
* CNN feature extraction: this paper use OxfordNet and TorontoNet
    * Pre-trained on ILSVRC2012 (image classification labels)
    * Fine-tuning on warped region proposals
        * Treat all region proposals with >= 0.5 IoU as positive
        * Add 1 additional background class
* Image classification: Use class-specific linear SVMs
    * Grid search the overlap threshold ($$IoU = 0.1\sim 0.5$$)
* Bounding Box regression:
    * Linear regression with ridge regularization.


##### [Spatial pyramid pooling networks (SPPnets)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.4729v4.pdf):
![SPPnet](/assets/images/cnn/SPPnet.png)

* To remove fixed size constraint in the convolution parts.
* [Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP)](http://mplab.ucsd.edu/~marni/Igert/Lazebnik_06.pdf):
    * Partition images into various size and aggregate them.
    
    
* SPPnet:
    * Replace the last pooling layer with SPP layer.
    * SPP layer outputs: $$kM$$-dimensional vectors
        * $$M$$ = the number of spatial bins
        * $$k$$ = the number of filters in the last convolutional layer
        

##### [Fast R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.08083v2.pdf)
![FastR-CNN](/assets/images/cnn/FastR-CNN.png)

* RoI pooling layer: Only one pyramind level in SPPnets
* Initialization: pre-trained ImageNet network with 3 modification
    * Replaced last max-pooling by RoI pooling layer.
    * Add a FC and softmax over K + 1 classes and bbox regressors.
    * Modify input into: a list of images and RoIs for each images.


* Comparison with R-CNN and SPPnet:
    * Fast R-CNN: For each batch, use RoIs from small set of images.
    * **End-to-End training for fine-tuning, classification, bbox regression.**


* Multi-task loss: 

$$
L(p,u,t^u,v) = L_{cls}(p,u) + \lambda [u\geq 1]L_{loc}(t^u,v)
$$
    
* $$[u\geq 1]$$ = 1 if $$u\geq 1$$ else 0 (background class: u = 0)
* $$L_{cls}(p,u) = -logp_u$$ is the log loss for true class $$u$$
* $$L_{loc}(t^u,v) = \sum_{i\in {x,y,w,h} } smooth_{L_1}(t^u-v_i)$$
    * $$L_1$$ loss: less sensitive to outliers and prevent exploding gradient.
    
$$
smooth_{L_1}(x) = \begin{matrix}
                     0.5x^2 & if |x| < 1 \newline
                    |x| - 0.5 & otherwise 
                  \end{matrix}
$$


* Speed up for detection using Truncated SVD
    * Motivation: Slow when many RoI vectors forward-pass fully-connected layers ($$W$$).
    * Factorize $$W$$ as $$W \approx U\sum_t V^T$$ ($$U: u\times t$$, $$\sum_t: t\times t$$, $$V^T: v\times t$$)

##### [Faster R-CNN (Region Proposal Network(RPN))](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5638-faster-r-cnn-towards-real-time-object-detection-with-region-proposal-networks.pdf)
![FasterR-CNN](/assets/images/cnn/RPN.png)

* Motivation: Region proposals cause computation bottleneck
    * Faster R-CNN = RPN + Fast R-CNN

* RPN: 2 additional conv layers (a kind of [FCN](#<a-href%3D"https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F1605.06211v1.pdf"-rel%3D"nofollow"-target%3D"_blank">Fully-Connected-CNN-(FCN)<%2Fa>))
    1. Encodes each position in feature map into a fixed-length vector. (nxn conv.)
    2. Score each vector an objectness score and regressed bbox for $$k$$ region proposals of various scale. (1x1 conv.)


* Translation-Invariant Anchors: a set of pre-defined bboxes
    * Each anchor can have different scales and aspect ratios 
        * Here they use 3 scales and 3 aspect ratios, resulting in 9 anchors at each position


* Loss function for learning region proposals
    * Labels for each anchor (object or background):
        * Positive:
            1. Highest IoU with ground-truth bboxes.
            2. IoU with ground truth $$\geq$$ threshold (e.g. 0.7)
        * Negative: IoU $$\leq$$ threhold (e.g. 0.3) with **all** ground-truth bboxes.
    * Multi-task loss: $$L({p_i},{t_i}) = \frac{1}{N_cls} \sum_i L_{cls}(p_i,p_i^*) + \lambda  \frac{1}{N_reg} \sum_i p_i^*L_{reg}(t_i,t_i^*)$$
        * $$p_i$$ = predicted probability of anchor $$i$$ being an object. ($$p_i^*$$ = true label)
        * $$t_i$$ = a vector of bbox coordinates. ($$t_i^*$$ = true coordinates)
        * $$L_{cls}(p_i,p_i^*)$$ = log loss over 2 classes
        * $$L_{reg}(t_i,t_i^*)$$ = smoothed L1-loss in [Fast-RCNN](#<a-href%3D"https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F1504.08083v2.pdf"-rel%3D"nofollow"-target%3D"_blank">Fast-R-CNN<%2Fa>)


* Share conv features between RPN and Fast R-CNN: 4-step training
    1. Train RPN (with ImageNet-pre-trained model and fine-tune end-to-end)
    2. Train Fast R-CNN using proposals from 1.
    3. Initialze RPN and fine-tune RPN with fixed shared conv layers.
    4. Fine-tune Fast R-CNN with fixed shared conv layers.


##### [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06870v3.pdf)
![Mask R-CNN](/assets/images/cnn/MaskR-CNN.png)

* Add mask branch ([FCN](#<a-href%3D"https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F1605.06211v1.pdf"-rel%3D"nofollow"-target%3D"_blank">Fully-Connected-CNN-(FCN)<%2Fa>)) for image segmentation into Faster R-CNN.


* Multi-task loss for each RoI: $$L = L_{cls} + L_{box} + L_{mask}$$
    * $$L_{cls},L_{box}$$ are the same as Faster R-CNN
    * $$L_{mask}$$ is the average binary cross-entropy loss of pixel-wise masks.
    * $$K$$ binary masks of resolution $$m x m$$ for $$K$$ classes.
    * _Decouple_ classification and segmentation by per-pixel sigmoid and binary loss.


* To fix misalignment, a quantization-free layer: _RoIAlign_
    * Use bilinear interpolation to compute exact values of input feature.
    * No quantization is the most crucial point.
    
    
* Network:
    * Backbone: for feature extraction, e.g. [ResNet](#<a-href%3D"https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F1512.03385v1.pdf"-rel%3D"nofollow"-target%3D"_blank">ResNet<%2Fa>), [FPN](#<a-href%3D"https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F1612.03144v2.pdf"-rel%3D"nofollow"-target%3D"_blank">Feature-Pyramid-Networks-(FPN)<%2Fa>)
    * Head: for regression, classification and mask prediction, e.g. FCN


### [Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03144v2.pdf)
![img](/assets/images/cnn/FPN.png)

* Main Goal:
> _The goal of this paper is to naturally leverage the pyramidal
shape of a ConvNet’s feature hierarchy while creating a feature pyramid that has strong semantics at all scales._

 
* To construct multi-scale feature maps for downstream tasks.
    * Utilize each level of conv-layers to produce multi-scale feature maps.
    * Each level of feature maps = Upsampling(Higher level) + Conv1x1(Current level)
    
    
* Applications:
    * For Region-proposal Network (RPN):
        * Attach the RPN head (3x3 conv and 2 1x1 convs) to each level of feature pyramid.
        * Each anchor has single scale, multiple aspect ratios for each level.
    * For Fast R-CNN:
        * Assign an RoI of width $$w$$ and height $$h$$ to level $$P_k$$ by: $$k = \lfloor{k_0 + log_2(\sqrt{wh}/224)}\rfloor$$
            * $$k_0$$ = target level that RoI mapped into
            * 224 is the canonical ImageNet pre-training size
        * Attach predictor heads to all RoIs of all levels.
