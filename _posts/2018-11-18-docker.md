## What is docker?
* A standardized operation-system-level virtualization program.
* It creates "container" similar to virual machine but more flexible and light-weight.
* The container provides an isolated environment for programs to run, without messing up your own computers.
* More documentation are [here](https://www.docker.com/)


## How to use a docker container?
1. Get a docker images or writing your own Dockerfile:
```bash
docker pull jr55662003/jupyterlab-dev
```

2. Run a docker container from docker images ([gist](https://gist.github.com/haochunchang/dc1076c8f5b171911e3883cef78fe4ce)):
    * -it: make the container interactive
    * -p [host port]:[docker port]
    * bash --> command you want the container to execute

```bash
docker run -it --name="Container Name" -v /dir/in/host:/dir/in/docker -p 8888:8888 jr55662003/jupyterlab-dev bash
```


## Connect to Jupyter lab in remote docker
* Assume the docker container is running on remote server

* Open jupyter lab in remote docker:
```bash
ssh 127.0.0.1 # your server IP
docker attach "Container Name"
jupyter lab --allow-root --ip=0.0.0.0
# Copy the printed token in localhost:token="..."
```

* In local:
```bash
ssh -N -f -L [local port]:localhost:[docker exposed port] 127.0.0.1
# Open browser and enter url: localhost:[local port]
# Login with the token or set new password
```

## Disconnect the remote docker:

* To close single ssh:
```bash
# List all ssh processes
ps aux | grep ssh
kill [pid]
```

* To close all ssh:
```bash
pkill -f "ssh -N -f -L"
```

* Or you can write into a bash script like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
PID=$(pgrep -f "ssh -N -f -L")

# Check if $PID is empty
if [ -z "$PID" ] 
then
    echo "No process need to kill."
    exit 1
fi
echo "Killing $(pgrep -f "ssh -N -f -L")"
pkill -f "ssh -N -f -L"
```
